        I remember a time when I would
        churn out love poems like a chef would
        churn out meals,
        My notebooks were never empty,
        my pens always out of ink,
        But now, I can never start a poem without
        frustration, hitting my head like a hammer to
        soft brick,
        I find it even harder to finish.
        I have all of these thoughts in my head,
        conversations I've had with myself that I had
        to write down,
        But it never feels the same.
        I've swapped my pen for a pencile because I don't
        take my writing seriously anymore.
        All I wanna do is tell you what I tell you every time
        I see you, 
        But in a way that makes it special every time I do.

        You have always, been the light in my world,
        You have been the essence of the earth that keeps me
        around and alive,
        You provide me with the requirements necessary to build
        a life,
        Most of all, you're the only source of hope that is
        yet to extinguish.
        You have a bad day but you push it under the rug
        You bury your head inside of a book and you do whatever
        it takes to make the bad day, worth it.
        You help me out of my shell, you helped me out of the
        prison that I was forced in to
        by the people who were afraid of me,
        You, you were the key to the door,
        You are the future of my being.

        I know you shouldn't be the dependancy of my happiness,
        You shouldn't have more weight and more worlds on your
        shoulders,
        But I wanted to let you know that without you,
        There would be no fire, there would be no gentle breeze
        in the Summer.
        I don't regret a thing about us, other than the fact we 
        can't spend more time together.
        I love you infinity,
        I'll be with you for always,
        Just as the sun never sets, never will the feelings I have
        for you, deplete into nothing.

        You're still here,

        I just can't believe,
        That I have you, in my arms,
        I wanna hold you close,
        maybe for a lifetime - never let you go,

        I wanna hold your hand,
        Just for a moment, but I see the crack,
        I love you,

        Your smile is still fresh in my mind,

        Flexing his muscles, but I know I'm getting a slow death,
