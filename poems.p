S'The light in my world'
p1
S"\n        You have always, been the light in my world,\n        You have been the essence of the earth that keeps me\n        around and alive,\n        You provide me with the requirements necessary to build\n        a life,\n        Most of all, you're the only source of hope that is\n        yet to extinguish.\n        You have a bad day but you push it under the rug\n        You bury your head inside of a book and you do whatever\n        it takes to make the bad day, worth it.\n        You help me out of my shell, you helped me out of the\n        prison that I was forced in to\n        by the people who were afraid of me,\n        You, you were the key to the door,\n        You are the future of my being.\n\n        I know you shouldn't be the dependancy of my happiness,\n        You shouldn't have more weight and more worlds on your\n        shoulders,\n        But I wanted to let you know that without you,\n        There would be no fire, there would be no gentle breeze\n        in the Summer.\n        I don't regret a thing about us, other than the fact we \n        can't spend more time together.\n        I love you infinity,\n        I'll be with you for always,\n        Just as the sun never sets, never will the feelings I have\n        for you, deplete into nothing.\n    \t"

sS'Not As Strong As An Oak'
p3
S"\n        I couldn't find the pain to write, the voice to sing,\n        I hear the ringing of my phone and I know it's him,\n        The herald of failure, knocking at my door step,\n        Flexing his muscles, but I know I'm getting a slow death,\n        I left it too late - I always knew,\n        I'd this was never what I was meant to do,\n        The ink on my paper seems to dry out, as\n        the voices in my head are dying out,\n        The silence is deafening, the screams all perverted,\n        Whispers in the dark - how was it, I deserve this?\n        "

sS"I don't know what to say"
p5
S"\n        I remember a time when I would\n        churn out love poems like a chef would\n        churn out meals,\n        My notebooks were never empty,\n        my pens always out of ink,\n        But now, I can never start a poem without\n        frustration, hitting my head like a hammer to\n        soft brick,\n        I find it even harder to finish.\n        I have all of these thoughts in my head,\n        conversations I've had with myself that I had\n        to write down,\n        But it never feels the same.\n        I've swapped my pen for a pencile because I don't\n        take my writing seriously anymore.\n        All I wanna do is tell you what I tell you every time\n        I see you, \n        But in a way that makes it special every time I do.\n        "

sS'I Want You Here'
p7
S"\n        It's a matter of minutes, since I saw you,\n        Desperate? Yes.\n        The scent of your fabric softener still\n        caresses my senses, beautiful.\n        Your smile is still fresh in my mind,\n        those sweet words you whispered\n        in my ear,\n        I miss you too.\n        "

sS'I Wanna'
p9
S"\n        I close my eyes,\n        wake up in the morning, before I realise,\n        You're still here, \n        I thought you left forever, but you're still my dear.\n        I just can't believe,\n        That I have you, in my arms,\n        I wanna hold you close,\n        maybe for a lifetime - never let you go,\n        I love you, \n        tears hit my cheek, but I know it to stand true,\n        I just can't believe, \n        that I have you, in my arms!\n\n        I'll wait up,\n        I understand your work is so challenging,\n        But I'll still miss you,\n        Waiting for the phone is like an eternity,\n        I want to believe,\n        You'll let me hold you, in my arms,\n        I wanna hold your hand,\n        Just for a moment, but I see the crack,\n        I love you,\n        But all you do is smile and never say it back,\n        I want to believe,\n        You'll let me hold you, in my arms!\n        "
